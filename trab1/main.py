This programme consists of a GUI application with the purpose of
communicating with an Arduino via USB.

The Arduino should be equipped with a command parsing software to fulfill
the requests given by this software.

These commands may consist of a key-word (example: acquire), followed by
various parameters, depending on desired functionalities.

Additionally, a 'request_commands' command should be implemented in the
Arduino software, returning a description of the implemented commands,
so that users can perform various operations without needing to check the
code developed there.

Enjoy!
